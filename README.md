Traffic_tweets_analysis-
========================
The project is undertaken by District Department of transportation to help the TMC operators identify and detect incidents with supplement information from social media. 
The application will also provide an archive of all the incidents taking place in the area. 
The application is developed in python and uses MongoDB as the database due to consideration of unstructured data.
